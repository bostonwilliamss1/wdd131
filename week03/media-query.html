        <h2>Words of Mormon 1:7</h2>
        <p>
        And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings 
        of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the 
        Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according 
        to his will.
